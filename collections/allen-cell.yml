description: >
  Three napari tools developed by the Allen Institute for Cell Science during the creation of the Allen Institute's Image Analysis Pipeline. 
    AICSImageIO handles image reading and writing with attention to metadata conversion. 
    Segmenter allows robust 3D segmentation of both cells and structures using classic image segmentation workflows. 
    These tools allow researchers without deep computational backgrounds to easily leverage high-level image curation and analyses on their datasets.

# provide a cover image for the collection. 
# this must be at least 1400px and be present in the top-level `images` folder in this repo (note: include full file name with the file extension)
